1) *DONE!* Add an extra descriptive element (or more) to the condiment by including another dataset from the corpora

2) *DONE!* Fix the issue of using 'a' instead of 'an' by writing code that checks if the word following an indefinite article (e.g. 'a') starts with a vowel and use 'an' instead in that case

3) *DONE!* Allow the user to refresh the description by clicking on the page rather than having to reload it
