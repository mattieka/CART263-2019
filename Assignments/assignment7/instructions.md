INSTRUCTIONS

- *DONE!* Prevent each mouse click from starting the music interval again! You only want to start the music one time.
- *DONE!* Change the code so that the synth doesn't necessarily play a note every beat (i.e. it can have rests/silences). (You'll need to be able to explicitly stop the synth if there's going to be a silence.)
- *DONE!* Change the code so that the synth can play notes of different durations that are multiples of the basic note length. (You'll need to use setTimeout() to play notes instead of setInterval() so you can vary the duration of the delay to the next note.)
- *DONE!* Use Pizzicato to add filters to the synth and the drum sounds so that you get a more interesting sound out of the instruments.
