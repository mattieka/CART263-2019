GAME STORE EMPLOYEE SHELVING SIMULATOR

Summary:
Have you ever wondered what it's like to work in video game retail and to have to shelve dozens and dozens of near-obsolete games?? Wonder no longer!


/******************************************************************************
                                THE ~VISION~
******************************************************************************/

What the player does:
- *DONE!* User can move "games" from the pile on the counter (normal list) to the shelf (grid list)
- *DONE!* and vice versa

The user's goal:
- To alphabetize the games on the pile on the counter

Obstacles stopping the user:
- "Customers" putting things back in the wrong place
- "Customers" who won't shut up
- "Customers" who also happen to be toddlers who knock an entire shelf off the wall while running through the store
- *DONE* More games getting added to the list

Gameplay:
- user drags and drops games from the list to the grid and is told to alphabetize them
- at random time intervals, more games are added to the list on the counter
- also at random time intervals, dialog boxes representing customers speaking pop up on screen
- closing one opens another until the "conversation" is over;
      - while this is happening, games can still be added to the counter, but the user cannot move them until they are finished speaking to the customer
- the user understands the sisyphean hellscape that is called retail
