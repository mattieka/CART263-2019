Game Shelving Simulator
By Mattie KA

Have you ever wondered what it's like to work in video game retail and to have to shelve dozens and dozens of near-obsolete games?? Wonder no longer!

My version of the myth of Sisyphus was inspired by the two years I spent in video game retail. The XBOX360 wall of the store that I worked in was in a perpetual state of disrepair no matter how many times I reorganized it, and here's why:

Generally, the actual games are kept behind the cash wrap, so the cases on the shelves are display-only. When a customer takes a case from the shelf and brings it to the register, the case winds up back on the counter for another employee to shelve afterwards.

Additionally, customers would remove the cases from the shelves to look at them, then inevitably put them back in the wrong place. Sometimes, games were relocated to different parts of the store. Occasionally, a particularly energetic toddler would take out an entire shelf with one well-aimed flailing of an arm. Because of situations like these, it felt like alphabetizing the wall of games was pointless.

I reflected this sentiment into my project: it doesn't actually matter if the user alphabetizes the games or not. More will be added to the counter list regardless.

The dialog boxes that pop up at random times represent the customers in the store who took my attention away from organizing the shelves. Even while assisting customers, more games would to put away would still be added to the counter. To symbolize this experience, I deliberately allow my project to continue adding games to the counter even while a dialog box is active.

Since it is generally considered rude to multitask while interacting with a customer, the dialog boxes in my project stop the user from doing anything else until the dialog box is closed.

There is no limit to the amount of games that this project can generate, so it is truly a sisyphean struggle to attempt to shelve them all.

I wanted to have the customer dialog boxes generate some custom dialogue pulled from another array, but I couldn't figure out how to structure all of the conversations and the associated data (what text goes in the box, what text goes in the buttons, if another dialog box is triggered afterwards, etc) as a text or JSON file.
