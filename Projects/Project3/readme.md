ARTIST STATEMENT

Deity's Domain is a project I'm tentatively working on.
It contains seven central characters who reoccur throughout a lot of my work.

The purpose of building this version of the excerpt was...
1) to get a handle on the characters
2) learn how to use Phaser, as it is a much more powerful game engine than javascript on its own.
3) learn how to use Tiled in tandem with Phaser. 

Deity's domain is about coping with the feelings that come with a broken or damaged friendship.
