Phaser 3 Vocabulary
From this helpful article: https://medium.com/@jerra.haynes/a-real-persons-guide-to-phaser-3-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-gun-part-1-9cc6361f377c

*Game*: "This is everything you’re making, all together! You declare it once, in an index file, and then only call upon it if there’s something in, say, the config that we need to access. "

*Scenes*: "A title screen would be one scene, an options selection another, and each ‘level’ or ‘room’ or ‘area’ in a game would be their own"

*World*: "your ‘world’ is whatever area your character has access to in a given scene. In the infinite runner example, the game world would be everything! If you wanted to divide your game up into ‘rooms’, then the size of each room would be the ‘world’."

*Physics*: "This is whatever physics engine you’ve decided to use. There are three engines by default in Phaser 3: the Arcade, Ninja, and P2 physics engine. You can enable or disable these engines in general, change it for a particular area, or turn on and off specific laws of physics for scenes or objects at your whim."

*Sprite*: "the image for something onscreen. Can be animated. It takes a little more time to load and a little more energy from your processor to render" than images.

*Images*: Pretty much exactly the same as a sprite, except without the animation functionality.
