Navigating YouTube: Toddler Edition
by Mattie K.A.

Navigate YouTube as it is in the current internet climate as a child. Unable to read, users can only make decisions of what "videos" to watch based on the thumbnail images.


I had actually read James Bridle's essay before it was brought up in class, and it was (and still is) extremely alarming to me, especially because I work in childcare. However, because I work with an older age group that is generally more internet-literate than say, a toddler, I didn't reflect on it too much until now.

I felt that it would be helpful to try to put myself in a toddler's tiny little shoes to try to understand how what they watch makes them feel from their perspective. I tried to imagine what it would be like to navigate the minefield that is the youtube algorithm with 0 reading ability, and no inkling that there might be people out there making scary or malicious content that could harm them.

I decided then that this exercise would actually be a good basis for a project. The goal would be to help people understand the potential ramifications of early childhood exposure to graphic or frightening media. To do this, I would do my best to force users to see what it's like to navigate youtube from a young child's perspective, and draw interest and attention by turning this experience into a game.

I started by going down the rabbit hole of related videos (it was awful) to gather images. I blurred the text, which I think helped solidify the project in two important ways:

  1) it made the experience visually unnerving: as adults, we expect to be able to read the titles and descriptions of videos in order to get an idea of what the video is about.

  2) it made the experience feel more convincing: blurring the text was the closest thing I could think of that would mimic a toddler's inability to read.

The rest was to try to emulate youtube's layout as much as I could. Because I'm not a CSS-wizard, I mostly did this with screenshots. So stuff like the autoplay button and the search bar aren't actually functional. It would be interesting to make them functional somehow, but I wouldn't even know where to begin.

The next thing I worried about was justification for why the mood meter would go up or down. I didn't want to post Extremely Graphic Youtube Filth in my project, so I used speech synthesis to explain what was good or bad about each video selected.

Finally, to keep things consistent visually, I made it so that the only "words" that appear onscreen are dialog boxes with instructions, game over alerts, and content warnings. This is why I used speech synthesis for the explanations rather than text.

All in all, I think my project would help someone understand what James Bridle was trying to convey in his essay.
