<div>It shows no interest in <span class = redacted>anything that isn’t fresh.</span> If you take it shopping with you, it will help you pick out ingredients.</div>
<div>Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds <span class = redacted>bird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree</span> sprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.</div>
<div>Carrying food through <span class = redacted>Fearow’s territory is dangerous. It will snatch the food away from you in a flash!</span></div>
<div>The reason it guides people all the way down to the mountain’s base is that it <span class = redacted>wants them to hurry up and</span> leave.</div>
<div>Every once in a while, <span class = redacted>you’ll see a Golbat that’s missing some fangs.</span> This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.</div>
<div>While it’s <span class = redacted>quite friendly toward humans</span> once it’s grown used to them, in the wild it must be quite fierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.</div>
<div>Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the spoons it carries. <span class = redacted>Each spoon is an original that there’s</span> only one of in the whole world.</div>
<div>When Golem grow old, <span class = redacted>they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long,</span> long time have shells green with moss.</div>
<div>There are a hundred or so of them living in Alola’s waste-disposal site. <span class = redacted>They’re all hard workers who eat </span>a lot of trash.</div>
<div>It can be spotted near recreational <span class = redacted>facilities, intending to eat the pleasant </span>dreams of children who enjoyed themselves there that day.</div>
<div>Its pantomime skills are wonderful. You may become <span class = redacted>enraptured while watching it, but next thing you know, </span>Mr. Mime has made a real wall.</div>
<div>It fires <span class = redacted>hyper beams in all directions, burning </span>the surrounding area to ash. There are some regions where it’s called “the deity of destruction.”</div>
<div>It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power to predict the future, <span class = redacted>it’s not powerful enough to </span>change the future it sees.</div>
